# PCB


These are all the PCBS I've helped designed or designed so far. Included are: 

1) A High Voltage to Low Voltage conversion board for the Motorsports team.
2) A voltage monitoring board for an autonomous vehicle
3) A brake board that switches from manual mode to PWM braking for the autonomous vehicle
4) A board that provides a Compressor effect when hooked up to a guitar signal
5) An in-the-works board that will serve as an Electronic Speed Controller for an electric skateboard
