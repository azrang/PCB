# PCB


These are all the PCBS I've helped designed or designed so far. Included are: 

~ @ my first full time job ~
** SLIGHT flex, this was all designed, assembled, and working in one month. I was solo Electronics Engineer. **
1) Node Board: utilizes ESP32-S3 WROOM to monitor the machine using CANBus between each node and to control the various hat boards.
2) 12V Hat Board: controls whether 12V is applied to high current loads using a high side switch.
3) 120VAC Hat Board: controls whether 120VAC is applied using triacs, optocoupler triac drivers, and a snubber circuit, for inductive loads.
4) 5V sensor Hat Board: Reads sensor data and applies 5V power through a buck circuit. 

~ @ The Cooper Union ~
1) A High Voltage to Low Voltage conversion board for the Motorsports team.
2) A voltage monitoring board for an autonomous vehicle
3) A brake board that switches from manual mode to PWM braking for the autonomous vehicle
4) A board that provides a Compressor effect when hooked up to a guitar signal
5) A Holiday Tree shaped board that lights LEDs up (used as part of a workshop to teach students PCB building)
6) An in-the-works board that will serve as an Electronic Speed Controller for an electric skateboard
